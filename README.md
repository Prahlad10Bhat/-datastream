Concept

You’re a glowing data packet moving through a digital circuit.
You must dodge firewalls (red blocks) and collect powerups (green nodes) while the speed keeps increasing.

| Action              | Description                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tap / Space / Click | Makes the data packet jump or pulse upward. Gravity pulls it down.     |
| Obstacles           | Firewalls appear as red rectangles moving left. Collision = game over. |
| Powerups            | Green circles give small score boosts or slow time for a second.       |
| Scoring             | 1 point for each firewall passed, +5 for each powerup collected.       |
